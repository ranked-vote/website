<p>
  All of the analysis that goes into approval.vote reports is based only
  on ballot-level data.
</p>

<p>
  In some cases, these tabulations don't match the official tabulations.
<p>
  Another source of discrepancies is the handling of undervotes/overvotes and
  write-ins.
  To the extent possible, we follow the statutes in the relevant jurisdiction
  in order to treat ballots the same way that the elections
  board does. But statues aren't code, so there are sometimes cases
  where there are ambiguities around edge cases. In particular, the treatment
  of write-in candidates can be a complicating factor, because many jurisdictions
  replace them with a generic “write in” dummy candidate, which does not always
  reflect how they are treated in the official tabulation.
